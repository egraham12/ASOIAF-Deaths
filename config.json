Created in Gephi and exported using the Sigma.js plugin from the Oxford Internet Institute. I didn't re-read the series to create this, and instead pillaged A Wiki of Ice and Fire for their data. <br>A few notes on arbitrary decisions:<br>(1) When characters had conflicting/changing allegiances, I chose the region they're from<br>(2) If someone is kicked into a bear pit, I attributed it to the character who did the kicking rather than the bear<br>(3) When possible, avoid using a generic group (e.g. Bolton soldiers) and connect the person who ordered it (e.g. Ramsay Snow)<br>(4) Red arrow indicates direct responsibility, orange arrow indicates indirect responsibility",
